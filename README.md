# streamlit-sales-app
This repository contains code for a sales forecasting project using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The project aims to predict future sales based on historical sales data, leveraging deep learning techniques for time series forecasting.
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting historical sales data.
LSTM model development: Building and training an LSTM neural network to learn patterns in the sales data.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
Streamlit web app: Implementing a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit to visualize sales predictions and interact with the model.
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.
